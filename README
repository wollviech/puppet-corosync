= Requirements 

This module requires the following modules:

* A logwatch module that exports the config directory for logwatch in the variable
  $logwatch::params::logrotate_d
* The concat module

= Example

The following example will do a few things:

1) It will install corosync for use with pacemaker 1.0 (ie: pacemaker will be started
   by corosync)
2) It will set rrp_mode to active
3) It will activate secure authentication
4) It will create two rings and corresponding firewallrules for them
